# Interactive Web Experience: CSS3 & JavaScript Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to bring web pages to life using CSS3 transitions, keyframe animations, and JavaScript functions. It is structured into three clear parts, each labeled and commented in the code for easy understanding and grading.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `index.html` — Main HTML structure, with sections for each part of the assignment.
- `styles.css` — All CSS transitions, keyframe animations, and styling.
- `script.js` — JavaScript functions showing parameters, return values, scope, and dynamic animation triggers.

---

## 🎨✨ Part 1: CSS3 Transitions and Animations
- **Button hover effect:** The "Hover Me!" button uses a gradient, scaling, and shadow transition.
- **Fade effect:** The fade box smoothly changes opacity on hover.
- **Continuous animation:** The slide box moves back and forth using `@keyframes`.

---

## 📚✨ Part 2: JavaScript Functions — Scope, Parameters & Return Values
- **Reusable functions:** Includes a `sum(a, b)` function with parameters and a return value.
- **Scope demonstration:** Shows the difference between global and local variables.
- **DOM interaction:** Functions update the page with results when buttons are clicked.

---

## 🎨🎬 Part 3: Combining CSS Animations with JavaScript
- **Triggering CSS animations:** JavaScript adds/removes classes to start CSS animations (e.g., animating a box on button click).
- **Modal popup:** A modal slides in and out, controlled by JavaScript.
- **Reusable animation trigger:** Bonus function to trigger any animation class on any element.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Interact with the buttons and elements in each section to see the effects.
3. Review the code in `styles.css` and `script.js` for clear comments and modular structure.

## 💡 Notes
- All code is commented and organized for clarity.
- You can expand on this project by adding more animations or interactive logic.
